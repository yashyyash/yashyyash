### 👋 Hey there, I’m Yash!

👨‍💻 **Software Enthusiast** | **Product Management Explorer** | **Fitness Aficionado**  

💡 I'm passionate about coding in **C, Java,** and **Python**, constantly seeking ways to solve complex problems through technology.

🚀 Currently learning **AWS** and **Medusa**, and always excited to explore new technologies that push the boundaries of what's possible.

🎶 Fitness, **music**, and **fintech** apps are my jam! If you're looking for someone to collaborate on innovative projects, I'm your person.

🌐 Find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yash-mutatkar) and let’s connect!  

💬 Fun fact: When I’m not coding, you'll probably find me lifting weights, listening to DHH, or brainstorming the next big app.
