ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Yash!
ðŸ‘€ Passionate about programming, I work primarily with C, Java, and Python, while also delving into the world of product management.
ðŸŒ± Currently exploring AWS and Medusa, broadening my knowledge to bring more innovation to the projects Iâ€™m involved in.
ðŸ’ž Iâ€™m always up for collaboration on exciting new apps, especially those revolving around music, fitness, or fintech.
ðŸ“« Want to connect? Find me on LinkedIn:  www.linkedin.com/in/yash-mutatkar.
ðŸ˜„ Fun fact? I identify as a programmer first, but fitness and DHH keep me grounded outside of coding!
âš¡ Letâ€™s create something amazing together!
